aQuery - Write even less.

If you're tired of writing shit-tons of code, then aQuery is the doodad for you, dad.

aQuery is a super-new fast and concise JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, Ajax interactions, and barnacle scrubbing for rapid web develoployment. aQuery is designed to change the way you view the world around you.

It's faster than that "other" query library. How do we know this? Because A comes before J in the alphabet. That's how.

Also, it's a joke. View the website for more... or less...
